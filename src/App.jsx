          I'm a software student that really likes art, but struggled to learn a
          cohesive theory of technique. My pursuit of art lead me to a pursuit
          of computer vision. This website is a place for me to train the skills
          that will be useful to develop visual comprehension and of art
          technique (outside of art meaning, technique as a series of tools for
          art) For now there is only a value trainer, enjoy
